        <p> Hola! My name is Yadira Morales, and I'm originally from the beautiful city of Ensenada, Mexico, where the fish taco was invented. However, I currently reside in Utah with my husband and three kids, and I am pursuing a career in software engineering. Why? Because I am passionate about learning and willing to take risks to achieve my goals. I believe that pursuing a career in software engineering will challenge me to think outside of the box, and allow me to make a positive impact on the world.</p>
