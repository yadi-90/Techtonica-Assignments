            As the first rays of Saturday's sun gently kissed my childhood bedroom, a tantalizing aroma would fill the air, beckoning me to the kitchen with eager anticipation. It was the unmistakable scent of "Birria" - a cherished tradition that permeated my childhood home. This delectable meat stew, hailing from the vibrant state of Jalisco in Mexico, was the heart and soul of our Saturday mornings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Birria, a symphony of flavors and textures, is crafted from succulent meats such as goat, beef, lamb, mutton, or chicken. The secret lies in the preparation - the meat is marinated in a heavenly adobo concoction, crafted from a harmonious blend of vinegar, dried chiles, garlic, and a medley of fragrant herbs and spices. This magical marinade infuses the meat with layers of complexity, ensuring each tender bite is a divine culinary revelation.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the early days, my mom's friends suggested that her Birria was something special, something that should be shared with the world beyond our apartment complex. And so, a humble yet ingenious plan was hatched. Before the era of Ubereats and Doordash, I found myself donning the hat of a young delivery person, taking orders over the phone from eager customers. From 6 am onwards, the phone would ring incessantly, as the demand for our heavenly Birria soared. By noon, our savory treasure trove would be sold out, leaving satisfied smiles on the faces of those lucky enough to savor its wonders.

            With the Birria business flourishing, my mom's culinary prowess not only touched hearts but also led us to greater heights. As our Birria dollars accumulated, we celebrated a remarkable milestone – the acquisition of a car, expanding our operation to reach the next apartment complex nearby. With wheels at our disposal, we embarked on a flavorful journey, delivering satisfaction and nostalgia to the palates of our growing clientele.
           </p>
           <p>
            As life tends to move forward, our Saturday enterprise eventually gave way to new beginnings when we moved to a home of our own. However, one thing remains unchanged – the allure of Birria still transports me back to those cherished memories. With every spoonful of this marvelous stew, I'm transported to those bygone Saturdays, where the essence of family, love, and culinary artistry blended together in perfect harmony.
           </p>

           <p>
            Today, as I relish the comforting taste of Birria, I'm reminded of how food has the power to etch indelible memories in our hearts. Our humble venture may have been short-lived, but its impact continues to resonate, forever bound to the soulful aromas and flavors of Birria - a timeless dish that will always hold a special place in my heart.

        <h3> Preparation</h3>
        <ol type ="1">
            <li>
                Season the meat with salt, pepper, and cumin  
            </li>
            <li>Cut open the dried chiles with scissors and remove the seeds</li>
            <li>Fry the dried chiles with a small amount of oil in a frying pan for 2-3 minutes, moving constantly so they don't burn. Set aside
            </li>
            <li>Add the chiles from the previous step to a small pot with boiling water for about 10 minutes, or until softened.</li>
            <li>In the same frying pan where you fried the chiles, add 1 tablespoon of oil and cook the onions and tomatoes until they are browned. Add the garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves, cinnamon stick, and all of the remaining spices except for the ground cumin and ginger. Continue cooking for about 5 minutes, moving it around often.</li>
            <li>Add the chiles (including the water), the ingredients from the previous step, and the ginger, cumin, apple cider vinegar and water to a blender and blend until smooth. It will still be pretty thick, but that is fine. Strain and set aside the resulting sauce for the next step.</li>
            <li>Pour the sauce over the meat in a large bowl and cover. If using the oven or stovetop methods, you will want to marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight. If using the electric pressure cooker option, you can marinate it, but it isn't necessary.</li>
            <li>Follow the cooking instructions according to your preferred method below.</li>
            <li>Add the meat with the marinade to a large stockpot and cook over medium heat, covered, for about three hours, or until the meat falls off the bones and is easy to shred.</li>
            <li>Remove the meat and shred it. You can then serve it over the soup made from the sauce that the meat cooked in or you can serve it with tortillas as tacos with cilantro, lime, onions, and salsa</li>
        </ol>
